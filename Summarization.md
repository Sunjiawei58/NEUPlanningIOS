This is my bachlor thesis projection, merging game elements with planning software

The main function of this system is to provide a bird’s eye view perspective map of Northeastern University for students.
While operating the map, students can set their own learning exercise plan and record their completion. The system uses
C/S architecture. The client part adopt Cocos2d-x engine to load the map, and implement the function of making and completing
the plans as well as friends communication.The server part is responsible for handling database operations and then storing 
the users’ data into the database.The system merges the game visual characteristics with the life planning software elements,
which greatly improve the students’ interests in using planning software.
